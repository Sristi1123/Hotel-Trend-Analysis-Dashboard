A comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze booking patterns, revenue performance, cancellations, and guest behavior across Resort and City Hotels. This project transforms raw hotel data into actionable insights that support operational decision-making and strategic planning.
# ⭐ Key Highlights of the Project
1. End-to-End Hotel Performance Analytics

This dashboard provides a consolidated view of all major hotel KPIs, including total bookings, revenue, occupancy rate, ADR (Average Daily Rate), cancellation rate, stay duration, and repeated guests.
It integrates multiple data dimensions such as months, booking status, guest types, room categories, and hotel categories.
The analysis enables stakeholders to understand both high-level trends and granular behavior patterns.
By bringing all metrics into one view, it simplifies complex data and supports quick, informed decision-making.

2. Comparative Analysis: Resort Hotel vs City Hotel

A dedicated comparison enables users to instantly contrast performance between Resort and City Hotels.
The dashboard identifies clear differences in customer behavior, booking patterns, and revenue flow across hotel types.
One of the major insights discovered is that Resort Hotels bring higher volume and revenue, whereas City Hotels maintain better occupancy with fewer cancellations.
This comparison helps businesses understand what drives performance in each segment and make targeted improvements.

3. Seasonal, Monthly & Weekly Trend Insights

The dashboard uncovers how bookings and stays fluctuate by season, month, and even day of the week.
Summer emerges as the strongest period for both booking volume and stays, while winter shows a notable decline.
Weekly calendar heatmaps highlight the busiest and slowest days, helping optimize staffing and pricing strategies.
These time-based insights help hotels anticipate demand and adjust operational planning accordingly.

4. Guest Behavior & Global Distribution Analysis

Deep analysis of guest segments reveals which groups cancel more often, which room types dominate, and how repeat guests impact performance.
Visuals include cancellations by guest type, visitors by season, room preferences, and stay patterns.
A world map visualization highlights international booking distribution, showing strong engagement from multiple regions.
Understanding guest behavior at this level helps hotels improve personalization, retention, and marketing targeting.
